1. Add image doesn't prohibit you from adding .psd files --> DONE (wasn't tested see if you can add photo-shopped images still)
2. Enter button doesn't work when submitting form (should work now, please test each form: forgot password, change password, login, register)


- resize screen and open hamburger nav menu, fix hover and padding between elements,
- when going to forgot password, should have some navigation after it to navigate back to login, put navigation on footer?
- register should be somewhere else because you can access it only when logged in (Amir's request)
- fix validation styling, make it look better
- overview content, border too thick
- find icon and title for museum (browser tab)
- create content see what happens on lower screen resolution, adjust to mobile view, also increase image name input field,
  upload field deteriorates when resizing screen
- must fix vs code Formatting!
