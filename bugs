1. Add image doesn't prohibit you from adding .psd files --> DONE (wasn't tested see if you can add photo-shopped images still, I cannot)


- resize screen and open hamburger nav menu, fix hover and padding between elements,
- when going to forgot password, should have some navigation after it to navigate back to login, put navigation on footer?
- register should be somewhere else because you can access it only when logged in (Amir's request)
- fix validation styling, make it look better
- overview content, border too thick
- find icon and title for museum (browser tab)
- Create content upload field is not red when no content in it and submit button pressed
- Create content mobile view scroll down and see what happens upload field overflow footer
- must fix vs code Formatting (should work now)!


TIPS
----
be careful not to use class attributes, use react className instead
